### Vitest
  
In the project I am using Vitest for unit testing. The React project was built using Vite, so Vitest (which is a Vite package) seemed like the obvious choice. I have established a series of tests for the project. My tests ensure that all the different pages and their content render and that the website navigation works correctly.
