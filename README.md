## Testing (Vitest)

<details><summary></summary>
  
<br/>
  
In the project I am using Vitest for unit testing. The React project was built using Vite, so Vitest (which is a Vite package) seemed like the obvious choice. I have established a series of tests for the project. My tests ensure that all the different pages and their content render and that the website navigation works correctly.

With Vitest you can run the tests continuously in the background. Whenever you make a change to a file the tests will run again. If the file you are working with is implicated in certain tests, then only those specific tests will run. Otherwise, all the tests will run. This means that you can work on the project and not worry about breaking things.
